## 1.2.2

### Improvements & Fixes

- Reduced webOS lag on HD Ready (1366x768) and webOS Hub sets by treating panel resolution as a separate performance signal: these devices now select the constrained rendering profile instead of the full one, which disables live backdrop blur, route and focus animations, promoted compositor layers, and extra Home image rows
- Restored the Chromium-to-webOS version mapping, which was unreachable because the guard tested a regex pattern against its own escaped source text; webOS Hub devices report the correct generation (23 instead of 108) and webOS 3.x sets get their compatibility styles back
- Fixed `webOS.TV-<year>` device info being read as generation 20, and aligned the Chromium-to-year fallback with the version table so Chromium 108 reports webOS 23 / 2023
- Processed each webOS pointer movement once instead of once per event name, and dropped sub-pixel pointer drift from a resting remote before it forced a layout
- Built the webOS package against the webOS JavaScript floor instead of the Tizen floor, removing ~110 KB of Chrome-56 transpilation and polyfills from every webOS install; the Tizen package is unchanged

- Kept Skip Intro visibility and D-pad focus synchronized with playback loading while containing left and right overlay navigation events (@WhiteGiso)
- Restored Android-aligned poster focus scaling across Home layouts and fixed subtitle rail sizing on legacy Chromium TV runtimes (@WhiteGiso)

## 1.0.10
