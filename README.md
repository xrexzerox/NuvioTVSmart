## Get Nuvio TV

Nuvio TV supports **Samsung Tizen TVs from 2018 onward (Tizen 4+)** and **LG webOS TVs from 2020 onward (webOS 5+)**.
The startup compatibility baseline is Samsung Tizen 4.0 / Chromium 56 and LG webOS 5.0 / Chromium 68 when the platform reports those versions.

Platform capabilities are intentionally version-dependent:

- **Samsung Tizen 4.x** — the app and direct playback are supported, but torrent/P2P playback is unavailable by design. Some advanced audio and subtitle features may also be limited.
- **Samsung Tizen 5.x, including 5.5** — torrent/P2P playback is supported through the bundled local EngineFS service only. The PluginService, plugin execution, and remote plugin pull/push synchronization are disabled; the Plugins screen is not available.
  The Node 4.4.3 service runtime observed on Tizen 5.5 is incompatible with the current PluginService syntax and URL APIs. Experimental legacy transports are not included; plugin support starts at Tizen 6.0.
- **Samsung Tizen 6+** — torrent/P2P and the packaged PluginService are supported. Plugin execution requires the packaged service plus the TV runtime's Worker and WebAssembly support. Tizen 6 and later use the same current Tizen service pipeline.
- **LG webOS 5.x** — torrent/P2P and the packaged plugin service are supported, with the limited plugin resource quotas used by the older webOS runtime.
- **LG webOS 6+** — torrent/P2P and the packaged plugin service are supported with the modern plugin resource quotas.
- **webOS Hub and HD Ready (1366x768) sets** — the runtime generation alone does not describe this hardware, so the panel resolution also selects the constrained rendering profile: live backdrop blur, route and focus animations, and promoted compositor layers are turned off, and Home loads fewer images per pass. Current webOS generations on 1080p and 4K panels keep the full rendering path.

On Tizen 5+ and LG webOS, torrent/P2P uses only the bundled local companion service; no external torrent streaming server is configured or required.

- [Samsung Tizen WGT](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart/releases/latest) for manual installation
- [LG webOS Homebrew repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVWebOS/main/webosbrew/apps.json)
- [LG webOS IPK](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart/releases/latest) for manual installation

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart.git NuvioTVSmart
cd NuvioTVSmart
npm install
npm run build
```

Build TV packages with:

```bash
npm run package:tizen
npm run package:tizen:store
npm run package:webos
```

`package:tizen` creates the unsigned WGT used by development and the Nuvio TV Installer. The installer signs it locally for the target TV before installation. `package:tizen:store` is a separate Seller Office build: it requires Tizen Studio/Web CLI and a configured security profile, and creates the signed Store package with the local EngineFS service included so Tizen 5+ retains torrent/P2P playback. Tizen 4 still reports P2P as unsupported at runtime. Nuvio TV is built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and platform TV APIs. Building requires Node.js and npm; package installation additionally requires the relevant Tizen or webOS tools.
